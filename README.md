## What is this?

PropTech-8Bit is a property technology dashboard with a fun retro gaming design. It helps property managers and executives see important information about their buildings, tenants, and business performance at a glance.

## What does it do?

This dashboard:

- **Shows property performance** - Track occupancy, revenue, and maintenance scores
- **Monitors smart building systems** - See real-time data from temperature, energy, and occupancy sensors
- **Analyzes tenant information** - Understand tenant satisfaction and predict which tenants might leave
- **Forecasts future results** - Test different business scenarios to predict revenue and occupancy
- **Identifies cost-saving opportunities** - Spot patterns in energy usage and maintenance needs

## Why is this important for our business in 2025?

### Cost Control in a Challenging Market

In 2025's real estate market, running buildings efficiently is critical. This dashboard helps identify ways to cut energy costs, optimize maintenance schedules, and reduce waste.

### Better Tenant Relationships

Understanding tenant needs and addressing issues before they become problems helps keep buildings full. The dashboard's tenant analytics help predict which tenants might not renew leases, giving time to take action.

### Smart Building Management

As buildings become "smarter" with more sensors and automated systems, property managers need tools to make sense of all this data. This dashboard turns complex information into simple visuals that help make better decisions.

### Data-Driven Decision Making

Instead of guessing what might work, this tool lets executives test different scenarios and see likely outcomes. This means more confident decisions about pricing, improvements, and property investments.

### Competitive Advantage

While many property companies still use outdated tools, this dashboard puts modern technology in an approachable package. By seeing problems before they happen and spotting opportunities others miss, we can outperform competitors who rely on traditional property management approaches.
